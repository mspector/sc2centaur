# SC2 Centaur

This README is being written years after the last time I worked on this project. It's pretty amateurish, and likely doesn't work anymore, but it was the first programming project that I undertook for purely personal reasons, and so it holds a special place in my heart.

The term "centaur" comes from the idea of [centaur (or advanced) chess](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_chess), a form of chess in which human-computer teams play chess against each other. This program was intended to "read" the player's screen and provide strategic insights based on what it "saw".

This project was inspired by that idea, extended to StarCraft II. I'm aware that "StarCraft: Brood War" has a better API for hackers, but I was playing a lot of SC2 at the time, and I wanted to use it myself :)
